Extract Relevant Tags: Focus on tags that are likely to contain price 
information, such as p, div, span, etc.

Filter by Money Symbols: Identify elements that contain money symbols (e.g., $, €, £).

Prioritize Sale Prices: If there are multiple prices, prioritize 
elements that indicate a sale or discount.

Use Contextual Clues: Look for contextual clues around the price, such as 
labels like "Current Price", "Sale Price", "Discounted Price", etc.

Validate and Clean Prices: Ensure the extracted price is valid and clean it 
by removing any non-numeric characters except the decimal point.
